# Alien_Invasion
This repository holds the first game I've created using python and the pygame module.

This game pays homage to arcade video game Space Invaders, created by Tomohiro Nishikdo.  

To Start the game use your mouse to click the Play button in the middle of the screen after you have run the program.
The ship moves laterally and with the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS and fires bullets with the SPACEBAR.

Your goal is to destroy every alien ship before its makes it way to surface or crashes into you.  
Each level becomes progressively more difficlut with the speed of alien invasion increasing in speed.
To end the game you can press 'q' or use your mouse to click the 'X' in the top right hand corner of the window.

I hope you enjoy!!!
